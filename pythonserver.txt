C:\Users\--\Documents>cd goldeneagle2

C:\Users\--\Documents\goldeneagle2>python -m http.server

http://localhost:8000/



 how to start the server in a new window:

1. Open a NEW Command Prompt or Terminal window:

Windows: Press the Windows key, type cmd, and press Enter to open a new Command Prompt window.

Mac: Open "Terminal" again from Applications -> Utilities or by searching in Spotlight. This will give you a fresh Terminal window.

important: use a new window each time

2. Navigate to your goldeneagle2 game folder in this NEW window:

Use the cd command to change directory to your game folder. For example, if your folder is still in Documents/goldeneagle2, you would type these commands, pressing Enter after each one:

cd Documents
cd goldeneagle2
Use code with caution.
Bash
Remember to double-check you are in the correct directory! After using cd Documents and then cd goldeneagle2, type dir (on Windows) or ls (on Mac) and press Enter. You should see index.html, game.js, and the assets folder listed, just like you did before.

3. Start the Python web server AGAIN in this NEW window:

Use the command below to start the server:

For Python 3.x:

python -m http.server
Use code with caution.
Bash
For Python 2.x:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Use code with caution.
Bash
You should see the message like "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000..." again in this new command prompt/terminal window.

4. Go back to your web browser and REFRESH the game page:

Go back to the browser tab where you had your game open at http://localhost:8000 (or whatever port). Perform a hard refresh to make sure it reloads everything:

Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + Shift + R or Ctrl + F5

Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + R or Cmd + F5
